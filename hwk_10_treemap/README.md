# Instructions 

Associative arrays can be created using BSTs. Finish the implementation of the TreeMap class. 

*putRecursively* is similar to BST's *addRecursively* with the difference that the comparisons are done with respect to the keys and when there is a match the node's value must be updated. 

*getRecursively* is similar to BST's *searchRecursively* with the difference that the comparisons are done with respect to the keys. 

Finish the TODO's in *TreeMap* and *TreeMapDriver*. When you are done, zip those 2 classes and submit the compress file on Canvas.
